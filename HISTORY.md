0.4.0 (2012-02-08)
==================

[Full changelog](https://github.com/webbit/webbit/compare/v0.3.8...v0.4.0)

In previous versions of Webbit, `WebServer.start()` was synchronous and `WebServer.stop()` was asynchronous (You could call `WebServer.join()` to wait for a complete shutdown.
As of this release, both `WebServer.start()` and `WebServer.stop()` are asynchronous, and they return a `Future<WebServer>` that can be used to wait for the operation to complete.

* Removed `WebServer.join()`. ([#70](https://github.com/webbit/webbit/issues/70) Aslak Hellesøy)

* Added `WebSocketConnection.onPing(byte[])` ([#71](https://github.com/webbit/webbit/issues/70) Aslak Hellesøy)
* Added `BaseWebSocketHandler` that implements `WebSocketHandler` with no-ops (except for sending pings back as pongs) (Aslak Hellesøy)
* Added `WebSocketHandler.onClose` and `WebSocketHandler.onClose` throw `Throwable` instead of `Exception` for consistency with other methods. (Aslak Hellesøy)
